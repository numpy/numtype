# Contributing to NumType

## Setting up the environment

Ensure you have [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
installed. Now you can install the project with the dev dependencies:

```shell
uv sync
```

You can also install it with a specific Python version, e.g. `3.11`, as

```shell
uv sync --python 3.11
```

## Linting and formatting with `ruff`

NumType uses `ruff` for linting and formatting, and is automatically installed
as a local development dependency. This way, you can lint all `.py` and `.pyi`
files with:

```bash
$ uv run ruff check
All checks passed!
```

Or, to format your code, run

```bash
$ uv run ruff format
351 files left unchanged
```

Be sure to do this before you open a pull request — the CI will complain
if you don't.

For more details, see <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/>.

## Type-checking and Testing

To validate that the annotations are correct and run tests, we use several tools:
[basedpyright], [mypy], and [pytest]. All are included as development
dependency-group, so that `uv sync` will install them by default.

### basedpyright

You can run basedpyright on the entire project using:

```bash
$ uv run basedpyright
0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes
```

Since this can take somewhere between 20 to 50 seconds to run, you may want to
limit this to a subdirectory or a specific file that you're working on.

See <https://docs.basedpyright.com/> for IDE integration and other info.

### mypy

Mypy is used for type-checking the codebase and the type-tests.

**General Type Checking**

To run mypy generally (excluding the main numpy dependency group):

```shell
uv run --no-editable --no-group=numpy mypy .
```

**Cache Issues**

In rare cases, the cache (`.mypy_cache` in the `numtype` root) can get corrupted,
leading to incorrect results. If CI output differs from your local output, delete
this directory.

The documentation can be found at <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/>, and issues can
be reported at <https://github.com/python/mypy>.

### pytest

Pytest runs runtime tests located in `src/*/@test`. It works out-of-the-box:

```bash
uv run pytest [OPTIONS]
```

For available options, see the [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html#args-from-file).

## Lefthook

[Lefthook] is a modern Git hooks manager, which automatically lints and formats
your code before you committing it. It will also keep your `uv` environment
up-to-date with the lockfile when you `git pull`.

To install it as a `uv` tool, run

```shell
uv tool install lefthook --upgrade
```

To set it up, navigate to the root of the `numtype` repo, and run

```shell
lefthook install
```

or

```shell
uvx lefthook install
```

Now let's see it all works:

```bash
$ lefthook validate
All good
```

See <https://lefthook.dev/> for more information.

## Tox

You can run the linters, type-checkers, runtime tests, and `stubtest`, all at
once through a single [tox] command.

It's easiest to install it as a `uv` tool:

```shell
uv tool install tox --with tox-uv --upgrade
```

To run it, navigate to the root of the cloned `numtype` directory, and run

```shell
tox p
```

or alternatively,

```shell
uvx tox p
```

If all is good, then you should see something like this appear:

```plaintext
ruff: OK ✔ in 0.05 seconds
pytest: OK ✔ in 0.34 seconds
3.11: OK ✔ in 20.44 seconds
3.12: OK ✔ in 22.32 seconds
3.13: OK ✔ in 26.41 seconds
basedpyright: OK ✔ in 27.33 seconds
  ruff: OK (0.05=setup[0.03]+cmd[0.01,0.01] seconds)
  pytest: OK (0.34=setup[0.02]+cmd[0.32] seconds)
  basedpyright: OK (27.33=setup[0.02]+cmd[27.31] seconds)
  mypy: OK (36.39=setup[0.02]+cmd[36.37] seconds)
  3.11: OK (20.44=setup[0.42]+cmd[20.01] seconds)
  3.12: OK (22.32=setup[0.44]+cmd[21.88] seconds)
  3.13: OK (26.41=setup[0.48]+cmd[25.93] seconds)
  congratulations :) (36.44 seconds)
```

Tox installs everything in isolated environments, so you don't have to worry
about your local or global `pip` or `uv` environments.

See <https://tox.wiki/en/stable/> for more information.

## Documentation

The documentation lives in `docs/`, the `README.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
Please read it carefully before proposing any changes.
Ensure that the markdown is formatted correctly with [markdownlint].

### Previewing Documentation Site

NumType uses [MkDocs] for documentation static site generation. To preview the documentation site locally:

```shell
uv run mkdocs serve
```

This will start a local server at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/numtype/> where you can preview your changes.
The server automatically refreshes when you make changes to the documentation files.

## Development Tools

NumType provides several development tools to help with development.

For detailed usage of each tool, please refer to the `README.md`
in the [`tool`][tool-docs] directory or the docstrings within each tool.

## Commit message style

For the most part, commit messages in NumType should follow
[NumPy's guidelines for writing commit messages][numpy-commit-style].
The main difference is that we don't use the prefix acronyms (e.g. `TYP`).
Instead, we use [Gitmoji] as a modern alternative.
Using it gitmoji is not a hard requirement, just a colorful recommendation.
For VSCode users it's most convenient to use the
[`gitmoji-vscode` extension](https://github.com/seatonjiang/gitmoji-vscode).

## Code style

For `.py` files, NumType follows the `black` style, and the `.pyi` stubs follow
the official [style guide for stubs][stub-style] in most cases.
Both `.py` and `.pyi` are linted and formatted using [`ruff`][ruff], which is
one of the development dependencies.

See the [NumType style guide](style.md) for more.
